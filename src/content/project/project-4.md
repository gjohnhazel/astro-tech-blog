So I had to make a couple tweaks to the astro-wordpress-starter because the Navigation Menu of WordPress has changed in the last year since he built it.
I submitted my first [Issue](https://github.com/JEverhart383/astro-wordpress-starter/issues/18) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/JEverhart383/astro-wordpress-starter/pull/19) on someone else's repository!
Between setting up two blogs and submitted that Issue & PR, these represent significant shifts in my approach to life, work, and technology from focusing inward to focusing outward.
I also learned a valuable lesson - when cloning someone's repo, check the most recent outstanding Issues & PRs, especially if you run into issues.
