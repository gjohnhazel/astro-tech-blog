I'm starting this blog because I feel I like to go deep down the technical rabbit hole frequently, and I want my primary blog to maintain accessibility.

Soooo I'm deep down this Astro rabbit hole. I'm enjoying it quite a bit. Thanks [Matthias](https://com-git-astro-iammatthias-team.vercel.app/)!

I started by building [this blog](https://blog.johnhazel.com/) as a project to use Obsidian as a CMS, then I built [this portfolio](https://portfolio.johnhazel.com/), and then I built [this linktree](https://linktree.johnhazel.com/). The 2nd two I built all in a couple of hours. These Astro themes are fantastic.

Matthias suggested it because I come from a PHP background, tinkering with WordPress sites, and it was a good call.

I'm just exploring all the free [Astro Themes](https://astro.build/themes/?search=&price%5B%5D=free) out there and seeing what I might want to build! What should I build next?
