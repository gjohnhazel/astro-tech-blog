I've used Zapier on occasion for somewhere around a decade now and I have always been a fan. But lately, I'm *really* enjoying Zapier. 
I've now discovered how to use the Zapier Platform, both the UI & CLI versions to integrate APIs into Zapier thus expanding its power immensely and effectively making Zapier my host for application backends. Which is far easier to maintain for a typical successor than a script running on a Lightsail server or something.

My latest project is automating processes in our ERP and Shipping Softwares. I'm pretty excited with the outcomes so far and the trajectory of it.

Anyway, if you haven't lately, check out Zapier! And feel free to reach out to me with questions or thoughts!
